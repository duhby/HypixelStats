# HypixelStats

Hypixel Stats is a project that allows players to more easily use the hypixel api to view players' stats in-game without having to visit a website, use a blacklisted mod, or an external program. It works by messaging a bot the username of a player or inviting the bot to a party and it will reply with the stats of the gamemode defined.
